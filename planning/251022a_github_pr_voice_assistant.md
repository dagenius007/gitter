# GitHub PR Voice Assistant

## Goal

Build a voice-enabled GitHub AI assistant that helps developers manage their pull requests through natural conversation. The assistant leverages the existing ZANA voice infrastructure (ElevenLabs TTS + OpenAI Whisper) and integrates with GitHub via direct REST API calls to provide hands-free PR management.

**Note**: Future versions may migrate to MCP (Model Context Protocol) for standardized GitHub interactions, but v1 uses direct HTTP API calls to avoid Docker/MCP server dependencies.

**Core capabilities:**

- List PRs assigned for review
- List user's own PRs
- Fetch and explain PR comments with context
- Advanced PR operations (merge, respond to comments, check status, view diffs)

All interactions are voice-based, building on the existing voice conversation flow already implemented in the codebase.

## Progress Summary

### ‚úÖ Completed (Frontend UI)

- **Voice-left, Content-right Layout**: Voice orb panel on left, GitHub content display on right
- **Session Management**: Fresh session on each page reload (localStorage cleared on mount)
- **Content Display**: Right panel shows only GitHub data (PRs, errors) with ChatGPT-style typing animation
- **Continuous Voice Loop**: Auto-restarts recording after TTS playback for seamless conversation
- **Audio Format Fix**: Improved MediaRecorder MIME selection and container format for better decoder compatibility
- **Request Session Continuity Fix**: Ensure consistent `sessionId` is sent in all requests within a session (fallback to localStorage when React state lags) and added debug logs for `X-Session-Id` roundtrips

### ‚úÖ Completed (Backend)

- **Classifier Prompt Strengthening**: Explicitly instruct classifier to use prior turns and avoid re-asking
- **Option B Enabled**: Embed full transcript into a single system message for intent classification (temporary for reliability)
- **Removed Repo Format Guidance**: Prompt no longer requires explicit `owner/repo` phrasing

### ‚ö†Ô∏è In Progress

- **Voice Recording**: Audio format issues on some browsers (testing codec support)
- **PR Data Display**: Basic structure in place; need real data from GitHub API

### ‚úÖ Completed (Database Integration)

- **Database Storage**: Migrated from file-based to PostgreSQL database storage for GitHub tokens and authentication
- **Migration System**: Created migration framework with automatic tracking and execution
- **Database Store**: Implemented persistent storage for session-based GitHub authentication
- **Fallback Support**: System gracefully falls back to file storage if database is not configured
- **Session Management**: Session ID stored in HTTP-only cookie with 30-minute expiration for security

### üîú Next Steps

1. Test database migration and OAuth flow with real database
2. Fix voice recording audio format issues (Safari/Chrome compatibility)
3. Test end-to-end voice flow with real GitHub data
4. Add error handling for GitHub API rate limits
5. Cost optimization: evaluate reverting to Option A (role-based history without transcript embedding) now that session continuity is fixed

### External Dependencies (to be integrated)

- **GitHub OAuth** - For user authentication and authorization
- **OpenAI API** - Already integrated; will be used for LLM reasoning about PRs
- **Future**: GitHub MCP Server - Consider migrating to MCP for standardized interface (requires Docker setup)

### Documentation

- `docs/WRITE_PLANNING_DOC.md` - Planning document guidelines (this doc follows that structure)

## Principles & Key Decisions

1. **Voice-first design**: All features must work purely through voice interaction; no manual UI navigation required
2. **Single user, github.com only**: Start with single-user OAuth flow; no GitHub Enterprise support in v1
3. **Database persistence**: Store GitHub tokens, session data, and user information in PostgreSQL database (migrating from file-based storage)
4. **Configurable LLM**: Allow switching between OpenAI models (and potentially other providers later)
5. **Incremental rollout**: Build in phases - listing first, then comments, then advanced operations
6. **Graceful degradation**: If GitHub API fails, explain the issue via voice rather than showing errors
7. **Context-aware responses**: LLM should understand PR context (reviews requested, authored PRs, etc.) and respond naturally

### Optimization Backlog (Cost/Latency)

- Revert to Option A classification once stable (remove transcript embedding, rely on role-based history and strengthened prompt). Rationale: session ID continuity bug caused earlier failures; with it fixed, Option A should work and significantly reduce tokens/cost and latency. Steps:
  - Update classifier to stop embedding transcript; pass role messages only

## Appendix

### Voice Command Examples

**Authentication:**

- "Connect my GitHub account"
- "Am I logged into GitHub?"

**Listing PRs:**

- "List my pull requests"
- "What PRs do I need to review?"
- "Show me PRs I'm working on"
- "Do I have any open PRs?"

**Comments:**

- "What are the comments on PR 123?"
- "Explain the feedback on my latest PR"
- "Are there any blockers on PR 456?"
- "Summarize the review for PR 789"

### GitHub REST API Research Notes

- **API Version**: GitHub REST API v3
- **Rate Limits**: 5,000 requests/hour for authenticated users, 60/hour for unauthenticated
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 with personal access tokens
- **Key Endpoints**:
  - Search PRs: `GET /search/issues?q=type:pr+...`
  - PR Details: `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}`
  - Comments: `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments`
  - Merge: `PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/merge`
  - Status Checks: `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{ref}/status`
- **Best Practices**: Cache responses, handle 403 rate limit errors, use conditional requests (ETags)

### GitHub MCP Research Notes (Future)

- MCP requires Docker container running GitHub MCP server
- Provides standardized interface across different code hosts
- Consider migration after v1 stable
- Benefits: Abstraction layer, easier to add GitLab/Bitbucket support later

### OAuth Implementation Notes

- To be filled during implementation
- Document token refresh strategy
- Note any security considerations
- Record testing approach for OAuth flow

### Alternative Approaches Considered

**MCP vs Direct GitHub API:**

- **Chosen (v1)**: Direct GitHub REST API calls
- **Rationale**: Simpler deployment, no Docker/MCP server required, faster to implement
- **Tradeoff**: Tighter coupling to GitHub API; future refactor to MCP may be beneficial for abstraction
- **Future**: May migrate to MCP when ready for Docker-based deployment

**Token Storage:**

- **Chosen**: File-based storage
- **Rationale**: Simple, works for single-user, survives restarts
- **Tradeoff**: Not suitable for multi-user without enhancement (future consideration: use database)

**LLM for Intent Detection:**

- **Chosen**: Use LLM for natural language understanding
- **Rationale**: Flexible, handles variations naturally, already integrated
- **Tradeoff**: Slightly slower than regex, but much better UX
